Need to exclude partial (SysInfo) file downloads in gather_data.ksh

Make the files in etc (remote.lis, source.lis) use variables 

Add Platform (unique Model/Serial#) count to Summary.
(even better make a syntax to count combined columns, OS/Virtual, Model/Serial#)

Make Admin a link to contact info. (link to Teamsite or HR lookup)

Make App a link to contact info. (get's this from Spreadsheet?, link to website)

Make Site a link to contact info.

Parse App Summary for boxes with multiple Apps.

Add mouse over notes and Help/Doc button.

Use DBM interface in place of CSV interface. (or not since CSV is editable)

Have the gen_req.pl read the source.lis to get parms into seperate
groups by source. Add a select all for each source.

* Use div instead of FRAME, 1 html file, much simpiler. (not working in firefox :-( )

Run the remote file collection in parallel. (much faster,
use Parallel::ForkManager or Proc::ParallelLoop)

Make the wait_for_remote function run from a list of remote servers.

Make the config files group dependent. If you run the gather script with
VzB as an option then it would use sys.VzB as the hostlist, source.VzB
and remote.VzB, etc. This way I could handle boxes setup differently
(like /tools/sysadm/bin v/s /apps/support/sysinfo/bin ) from the same
JADIS Server.

JADIS needs to show Decomd boxes and ADR-In-Progress boxes. Maybe in the spreadsheet. Run summary file generator against all hosts current+decomd then generate webpage against current only. We can run a report on Decom'd boxes.

JADIS should email reports to SA's to update missing or wrong info. Like
boxes that are down but not marked Idle. or Missing SysInfo or no dpphpux
access. With links to how to fix.

Do date math to highlight source file dates over a configured age.

Cleanup the JADIS.ini file for unused settings.

Install script should update etc files in an inteligent way.

Put back a link to most recent files for host. ?? Some SA's saved links to old files in bookmarks.
